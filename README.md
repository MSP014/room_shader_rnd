## 📋 Project Overview

This repository hosts the **Research & Development** efforts for a custom **Parallax Interior Mapping** solution using NVIDIA MDL. The goal is to create a high-performance, view-dependent depth slicing shader for simulating complex interior spaces in Urban Digital Twins (specifically for [Case 01: Moskovsky Av](https://github.com/MSP014/dt-omniverse-showreel-case01-msk)).

**Key Research Objective:**
To implement a "Window Box" effect that accurately simulates room interiors behind building facades without the geometry overhead, utilizing **View-Dependent Depth Slicing** and **texture-bombing** for randomization.

**Project Focus:**

- **Performance:** Minimizing texture lookups while maximizing visual fidelity.
- **Portability:** Creating a generic MDL module usable across Omniverse apps.
- **Proceduralism:** Generating compatible texture atlases via Houdini (Karma/VEX).

---

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

*This R&D module supports the "Smart Urban Fabric" initiative by providing lightweight visual complexity.*

- **MDL Architecture:** Custom functions for parallax correction and layer blending.
- **Houdini Pipeline:** Tools to bake room slices and depth maps into optimized atlases.
- **Verification:** Unit testing shader logic via `.usda` scenes and Python-driven validation.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Decisions

This project follows a **README-driven structure** to manage the complexity of hybrid Houdini/Omniverse pipelines.

## 💾 Project Data / Assets

### 🏭 The "Factory" Narrative
>
> This repository follows a strict **"Source vs. Artifact"** philosophy:
>
> - **Houdini (Fabricator):** The procedural "factory" where assets are generated. Source files (`.hip`) are proprietary and **excluded** from this repository.
> - **USD (Artifact):** The "product" of the factory. These are the optimized files needed to run the Digital Twin in Omniverse.
> - **Synthetic Data:** Telemetry streams are emulated via Python generators to simulate robust edge cases (e.g., extreme thermal loads) that are rarely captured in real-world data.

### 📦 Asset Hydration

To keep this repository lightweight, heavy binary assets (USD Crates, Textures, HDRIs) are stored externally.

- [**Download Asset Pack (One Drive / S3 Link TBD)**](https://example.com/placeholder)

**Hydration Steps:**

1. Download the ZIP archive from the link above.
2. **Extract contents** directly into the `assets/_external/` folder.
    - *Note: This folder already exists (anchored by `.gitkeep`), so you simply unzip into it.*
    - *Result:* Your local path should look like `assets/_external/usd/my_asset.usd`.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/MSP014/room_shader_rnd.git`
2. **Env:** Create conda env: `conda create -n shader_rnd python=3.10`
3. **Deps:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Hooks:** `pre-commit install`

## 📜 Changelog

- **2026-02-02:** Implemented external storage strategy for heavy assets (Git-agnostic).
- **2026-01-27:** Initial repository bootstrap. Established **Nvidia Showreel Standard** (ADRs, Pre-commit, strict PEP 8).
